# pyActoNet

Implementation of abduction-based control of fixed points of Boolean networks
([Biane et al, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2018.2889102)),
using Answer-Set Programming

The control predictions can be processed using the [algorecell_types](https://github.com/algorecell/algorecell_types) library, which eases the
display and comparison with other control methods.
